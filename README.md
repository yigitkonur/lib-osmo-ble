# DJI Osmo Pocket 3 — BLE Reverse Engineering & RTMP Streaming

> **Successfully achieved**: Full BLE pairing → WiFi configuration → RTMP livestream initiation on a DJI Osmo Pocket 3, entirely from the command line on macOS, without the DJI Mimo app.

## What This Is

A complete documentation of reverse engineering the DJI Osmo Pocket 3's Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol to enable programmatic control — specifically, triggering RTMP livestreaming from a Node.js application. This repository contains:

- **[PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md)** — Complete DUML-over-BLE protocol specification
- **[JOURNEY.md](JOURNEY.md)** — The full reverse engineering narrative with every wrong turn and breakthrough
- **[patches/](patches/)** — Working patches for the [node-osmo](https://github.com/datagutt/node-osmo) library
- **[experiments/](experiments/)** — Annotated debug logs from 14 iterative experiments
- **[analysis/](analysis/)** — Deep-dive analysis of each bug discovered
- **[reference/](reference/)** — Wireshark dissector and protocol notes from [xaionaro's research](https://github.com/xaionaro/reverse-engineering-dji)

## The Result

```
State change 0 -> 1    idle → discovering
State change 1 -> 2    → connecting
State change 2 -> 3    → waitingForDevice
State change 3 -> 4    → checkingIfPaired (sent PIN)
  ← Pairing response: payload=0002 (pairing required)
State change 4 -> 5    → pairing
  ← Pairing approved: payload=01
State change 5 -> 6    → preparingStream (Stage 1 OK)
State change 6 -> 7    → preparingStream2 (Stage 2 OK)
State change 7 -> 8    → settingUpWifi (WiFi connected)
State change 8 -> 10   → startingStream
State change 10 -> 11  → streaming ✅
```

The camera connects to a local WiFi network and pushes an RTMP stream to a specified server — all triggered over BLE from a single command:

```bash
node examples/connect-to-device.js <deviceId> 3 <ssid> <password> 'rtmp://server:port/live/key'
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and patch node-osmo
git clone https://github.com/datagutt/node-osmo
cd node-osmo
git apply ../dji-osmo-ble-protocol/patches/node-osmo-all-fixes.patch
pnpm install
npx tsc && cp src/cli.mjs dist/cli.mjs

# Install CLI globally
pnpm link --global

# Scan for your device
dji-osmo scan

# Get device info (battery, telemetry)
dji-osmo info <device-id>

# Start RTMP livestream
dji-osmo stream <device-id> --ssid MyWiFi --password secret --rtmp rtmp://server/live/key
```

## CLI

The `dji-osmo` CLI provides four commands:

```
dji-osmo scan                   Scan for nearby DJI Osmo devices
dji-osmo stream <id> [opts]     Start RTMP livestreaming
dji-osmo pair <id>              Pair with a device
dji-osmo info <id>              Show device telemetry (battery %, IMU, etc.)
```

### Example Session

```
$ dji-osmo scan
ℹ Scanning for DJI Osmo devices (10s)...

```

## The 7 Bugs That Prevented Everything

The journey to a working connection required finding and fixing **7 independent bugs**, any one of which silently prevented the protocol from working:

### Bug #1: ByteBuf Pool Offset (Root Cause of All Parse Failures)
Node.js `Buffer.alloc()` uses a shared 8KB memory pool. `ByteBuf` initialized its internal `#byteOffset` to `super.byteOffset` (e.g., 4096) instead of `0`, causing every single byte read to happen at the wrong position.

### Bug #2: ByteBuf DataView Length
`ByteBuf.from()` created a `DataView` without passing the source's `byteLength`, so it spanned the entire 8KB pool instead of just the message bytes.

### Bug #3: ByteBuf getUint24() Raw Array Access
`getUint24()` accessed the raw `Uint8Array(this.buffer)` without adding `super.byteOffset`, reading bytes from the pool start instead of the message.

### Bug #4: Message ID Byte Order
Message IDs were encoded as Little Endian but the wire format is **Big Endian** (confirmed by Wireshark captures from the DJI Mimo app).

### Bug #5: Wrong BLE Characteristic for Writes ⭐
**The single most critical discovery.** DUML commands were being written to characteristic **fff3** (which has `write` property). But the DJI Mimo app writes to **fff5** (which has `writeWithoutResponse`). The device silently ignores DUML commands on fff3.

### Bug #6: Fire-and-Forget BLE Writes
`writeMessage()` was synchronous and didn't `await` the async BLE write. Writes appeared to send (TX logged) but the BLE stack may not have delivered them.

### Bug #7: manufacturerData Discovery Guard
`onDiscover()` required `manufacturerData` in the BLE advertisement, but the Osmo Pocket 3 doesn't include it. The device was found by noble but silently filtered out.

## Device Compatibility

| Device | Model ID | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| DJI Osmo Pocket 3 | 3 | ✅ Verified — full pairing + streaming |
| DJI Osmo Mobile | — | Untested (likely compatible) |
| DJI Osmo Action | — | Untested |

## Requirements

- **macOS** with Bluetooth (tested on Apple Silicon / Sequoia)
- **Node.js** v18+ (tested on v25.5.0)
- **pnpm** package manager
- `@stoprocent/noble` (NOT `@abandonware/noble`)
- `blueutil` (for Bluetooth reset: `brew install blueutil`)
- An RTMP server (e.g., [MediaMTX](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx), nginx-rtmp)

## Known Issues

- **Rapid reconnections can crash camera's BLE stack** — the camera stops advertising and needs a power cycle. Always disconnect cleanly.
- **macOS CoreBluetooth state** — if the camera disappears from scans, run `blueutil --power 0 && sleep 2 && blueutil --power 1`
- **PIN code** — the default is `5160` but may vary. Check the camera's screen during pairing.
